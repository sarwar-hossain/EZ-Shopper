This web application allows users to browse a list of products and add items to their cart after creating an account and logging in. Once logged in, users can manage their cart, add shipping addresses, and place orders.

It uses `Java Servlets` for handling HTTP requests, `JDBC API` for database interactions, and `HikariCP` for efficient connection pooling. The front-end is rendered using `JSP (JavaServer Pages)`, while `CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)` facilitates dependency management. `MySQL` is used for storing user data, product information, and orders.
